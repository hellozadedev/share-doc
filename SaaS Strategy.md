## 2. BUILD TIMELINES & COSTS

### Comparison: Traditional vs AI-Powered Development

| Metric | ScamRadar (Traditional) | Closio (AI-Powered) | Future Model (Target) |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Timeline** | 3 months | 1 month (ongoing) | 1 month per MVP |
| **Total Cost** | $8,000 | ~$3,000 (so far) | ~$2,500 per MVP |
| **Dev Team** | 2 developers | 1 dev + Claude Code | 1 dev + AI tools |
| **AI Tools** | None | Claude Code | Claude Code + Lovable |

### ScamRadar Cost Breakdown (Traditional - No AI)
| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Developer (2 devs × 2 months) | $6,000 |
| Designer/Graphics | $1,500 |
| Infrastructure (server, AI, database) | $500 |
| **Total** | **$8,000** |

### Closio Cost Breakdown (AI-Assisted)
| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Developer (1 dev + Claude Code) | $1,500 |
| Designer/Graphics | $1,500 |
| Claude AI subscription | $100 |
| Server/Database | $50 |
| **Total (1 month)** | **~$3,500** |

### Future Model: Target Costs Per MVP
| Category | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Claude Code subscription | $200 |
| Lovable (landing pages) | $25 |
| Developer costs (2 devs) | $4,000 |
| Frontend dev  | $1000 |
| Server/Database/Infra | $1000 |
| **Total (2 MVPs/month)** | **~$6,500** |
| **Cost per MVP** | **~$3,000** |

## 3. EFFICIENCY GAINS WITH AI

### Key Metrics

| Factor | Before (ScamRadar) | After (Closio/Future) | Improvement |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Time to MVP | 3 months | 1 month | **3x faster** |
| Cost per MVP | $8,000 | $3,000 | **68% reduction** |
| Developers needed | 2 full-time | 1 + AI tools | **50% less headcount** |
| MVPs per month | 0.33 | 1-2 (target) | **3-6x throughput** |

### What AI Tools Enable
- **Claude Code**: Accelerates backend development, reduces debugging time
- **Lovable**: Rapid landing page creation without dedicated frontend time
- **Combined Impact**: Focus human talent on architecture & business logic

## 4. TEAM STRUCTURE & SCALING

### Current Team (4 members)
| Role | Count | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| Developers | 2 | Backend, integrations, AI implementation |
| Designer | 1 | UI/UX, graphics, branding |
| Project Manager | 1 | Coordination, planning |

### Target Operating Model: 2 MVPs/Month
- 2 developers work in parallel (1 MVP each)
- 1 designer supports both projects
- 1 PM coordinates both workstreams
- AI tools (Claude Code + Lovable) multiply output

### Scaling Philosophy: "Launch → Prove → Staff"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    LAUNCH TEAM                          │
│         (Builds & launches all new MVPs)                │
│                                                         │
│   2 Devs + 1 Designer + 1 PM + AI Tools                │
└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼ Product gains traction
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  DEDICATED TEAM                         │
│            (Assigned when revenue proven)               │
│                                                         │
│   Dedicated dev(s) maintain & grow the product         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scaling Triggers:**
- Product starts generating consistent revenue
- User base requires dedicated support
- Feature roadmap demands full-time attention

**Scaling Process:**
1. MVP launches with launch team
2. Monitor metrics (revenue, users, engagement)
3. When revenue threshold hit → assign dedicated developer
4. As product grows → add more dedicated resources
5. Launch team moves to next MVP

## 7. KEY TAKEAWAYS

### The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost reduction with AI | **68%** ($8K → $2.5K) |
| Time reduction | **67%** (3 months → 1 month) |
| Target MVPs per month | **2** |
| Target cost per MVP | **$2,500** |
| Current team size | **4 people** |

### Why This Model Works
1. **AI as Force Multiplier** - Claude Code + Lovable handle repetitive work
2. **Lean Launch Team** - Small team, high output
3. **Prove Before Scaling** - Only staff dedicated teams for winners
4. **Rapid Iteration** - More shots on goal = higher success probability

### Competitive Advantage
- Ship MVPs **3x faster** than traditional development
- **68% lower cost** per product launch
- **Flexible team** that scales with success, not speculation

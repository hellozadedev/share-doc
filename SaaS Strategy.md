## 4. TEAM STRUCTURE & SCALING

### Current Team (4 members)
| Role | Count | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| Developers | 2 | Backend, integrations, AI implementation |
| FrontEnd Dev | 1 | UI/UX, graphics, branding |
| Project Manager | 1 | Coordination, planning |

### Target Operating Model: 2 MVPs/Month
- 2 developers work in parallel (1 MVP each)
- 1 designer supports both projects
- 1 PM coordinates both workstreams
- AI tools (Claude Code + Lovable) multiply output

### Scaling Philosophy: "Launch → Prove → Staff"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    LAUNCH TEAM                          │
│         (Builds & launches all new MVPs)                │
│                                                         │
│   2 Devs + 1 Designer + 1 PM + AI Tools                │
└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼ Product gains traction
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  DEDICATED TEAM                         │
│            (Assigned when revenue proven)               │
│                                                         │
│   Dedicated dev(s) maintain & grow the product         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scaling Triggers:**
- Product starts generating consistent revenue
- User base requires dedicated support
- Feature roadmap demands full-time attention

**Scaling Process:**
1. MVP launches with launch team
2. Monitor metrics (revenue, users, engagement)
3. When revenue threshold hit → assign dedicated developer
4. As product grows → add more dedicated resources
5. Launch team moves to next MVP
